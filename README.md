# Stock-Analysis


## Overview of Project

Steve loves the workbook I prepared for him. At the click of a Run all Stocks button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although my code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

### Purpose

To find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year by editing and refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster. 

### Results 

Base on tables below, the stocks performance between 2017 and 2018 are totally different. Overall for Stocks performance in 2017 have been positive return. The stocks get return over 100% are DQ which is 199.45%, SEDG and ENPH. While TERP is the only stock that has negative return, which is -7.21%.  On the other hand, the overall stocks performance for 2018 are in the negative return. However,there are two stocks that have been in positive return, which are ENPH has dropped from 129.52% in 2017 to 81.7% in 2018 and RUN has significantly increased from 5.55% in 2017 to 84% in 2018. In addition, the pop up time boxes are showing that Refactored code successfully made VBA script run faster than Original Script about 0.55 seconds for both years.

### Summary
- Refactoring code can lead to advantages such as better comprehensibility facilitates maintenance and the extendibility of the software; however, there are also lead to disadvantages. For example, imprecise refactoring could introduce new bugs and errors into the code.

- Base on the Stock Analysis Project, the refactoring code helped developers write the code shoter by combinding both year togerther and made VBA script run faster and smoother as you can see the pictures of execution times of the original script and the refactored script above.
