# Stock-Analysis


## Overview of Project

Steve loves the workbook I prepared for him. At the click of a Run all Stocks button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although my code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

### Purpose

To find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year by editing and refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster. 

### Results Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## All Stocks 2017 Original Script

## All Stocks 2017 Refactored Script

Base on the line chart, 

## All Stocks 2018 Original Script

## All Stocks 2018 Refactored Script

According to the line chart, the most successful outcome is the goal setting at less than 1000 while the less successful outcome and the most failed outcome are the goal setting between 45000 to 49999. 


### Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Refactoring code can lead to advantages such as better comprehensibility facilitates maintenance and the extendibility of the software; however, there are also lead to disadvantages. For example, imprecise refactoring could introduce new bugs and errors into the code.

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Base on the Stock Analysis Project, the refactoring code helped developers write the code shoter and made VBA script run faster and smoother as you can see the pictures of execution times of the original script and the refactored script above.
