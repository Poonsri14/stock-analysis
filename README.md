# stock-analysis


## Overview of Project

Steve loves the workbook I prepared for him. At the click of a Run all Stocks button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although my code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

### Purpose

To find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year by editing and refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster.

According to the line chart, the most successful outcome is the goal setting at less than 1000 while the less successful outcome and the most failed outcome are the goal setting between 45000 to 49999. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

##Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

##Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

-How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
